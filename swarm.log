You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

Here's how each tool can be used effectively:\n\n1. **Read File Lines**: Use the `read_file_lines` tool to read data from a file. This is useful for loading data into a program for further processing. For example, reading a list of numbers from a file to perform calculations or searches.\n\n2. **Calculate Sum**: Use the `calculate_sum` tool to compute the sum of a list of numbers. This is particularly useful for aggregating data, such as calculating the total of a series of transactions.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: Use the `binary_search` tool to efficiently find the index of a target value in a sorted list. This is useful for quickly locating data without having to iterate through the entire list.\n\n4. **Merge Sorted Lists**: Use the `merge_sorted_lists` tool to combine two sorted lists into one. This is useful for consolidating data from different sources while maintaining order.\n\nIn this demonstration, we will:\n- Read numbers from a file.\n- Calculate the sum of these numbers.\n- Perform a binary search to find a specific number.\n- Merge the list with another sorted list.\n", 'tools_used': [{'name': 'read_file_lines', 'args': ['numbers.txt']}, {'name': 'calculate_sum', 'args': [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]}, {'name': 'binary_search', 'args': [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3]}, {'name': 'merge_sorted_lists', 'args': [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]}]}

These tools allow us to perform various transformations on strings, such as reversing the order of characters, capitalizing the first letter of each word, removing punctuation, and eliminating whitespace. Here is how each tool can be used:\n\n1. **Reverse a String**: Using \'reverse_string\', we can reverse the order of characters in a string. For example, reversing "hello" results in "olleh".\n\n2. **Capitalize Words**: Using \'capitalize_words\', we can capitalize the first letter of each word in a string. For example, transforming "hello world" results in "Hello World".\n\n3. **Remove Punctuation**: Using \'remove_punctuation\', we can remove all punctuation characters from a string. For example, removing punctuation from "Hello, world!" results in "Hello world".\n\n4. **Remove Whitespace**: Using \'remove_whitespace\', we can remove all whitespace characters from a string. For example, removing whitespace from " Python programming " results in "Pythonprogramming".\n', 'tools_used': [{'name': 'reverse_string', 'args': ['hello']}, {'name': 'capitalize_words', 'args': ['hello world']}, {'name': 'remove_punctuation', 'args': ['Hello, world!']}, {'name': 'remove_whitespace', 'args': [' Python programming ']}]}
